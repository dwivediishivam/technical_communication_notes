# Technical Communication: How to Read a Scientific Paper

## Purpose of Reading Papers for Researchers:

- Review for conferences or classes.
- Stay updated in their field.
- Survey a new field.

## The Three-Pass Approach:

### First Pass - Quick overview (5-10 mins).

1. Read the title, abstract, introduction.
2. Skim section/sub-section headings.
3. Read the conclusions.
4. Look over the references, noting familiar ones.

**Outcome:** Understand the 5 Cs:

- **Category:** Type of the paper (e.g., research, analysis).
- **Context:** How it relates to other papers/theories.
- **Correctness:** Are assumptions valid?
- **Contributions:** Paper's key points.
- **Clarity:** Quality of writing.

**Decisions:** Might stop if paper isn't in your direct interest.

### Second Pass - Detailed (up to an hour).

- Ignore intricate details like proofs.
- Make notes, annotate.
- Study figures, diagrams, graphs.
- Check results and conclusions.
- Mark key references for later.

**Outcome:** Grasp paper's content, able to summarize to others.

### Third Pass - Deep dive (1-5 hours).

- Virtually re-create the paper's work.
- Challenge every statement and assumption.
- Compare the actual content with your understanding.
- Note ideas for future work.

**Outcome:** Understand paper inside-out, identify strengths/weaknesses.

## Literature Survey Using Three-Pass Approach:

### Initial Search:

- Use academic search engines.
- Find 3-5 recent papers. Skim them.
- Review their related work sections for other references or survey papers.

### Key Paper Identification:

- Check shared citations and repeated author names.
- Check key researcher's websites to find where they've published.
- This identifies top conferences/journals in the field.

### Deep Dive:

- Visit top conference sites, check proceedings.
- Make two passes on these selected papers. Follow references iteratively.

## Applications of the Three-Pass Technique:

- Read conference proceedings.
- Write reviews.
- Conduct background research.
- Quick reviews before discussions.

## Evaluation Questions:

1. Main idea of the paper?
2. Research objectives?
3. Does title justify research?
4. Authors' methodology?
5. Do results support claims?
6. Identified and unidentified limitations?
7. Suggestions for future work?
8. Experts in the field?
9. Type and quality of the paper?
10. Publication venue and its credibility?
