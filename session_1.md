## 1. Introduction to Effective Technical Writing

**What is this about?**
This course is like a guidebook on how to write research papers, emails, resumes, and cover letters in a scientific way.
It also stresses the importance of not copying other people's work (plagiarism) and maintaining ethical practices in research.
Example: Think of academic writing as being the DNA of the science world. Just as DNA is precise, structured, and unique, your writing should also be clear, well-organized, and original.

## 2. What makes good writing?

- It's clear and logical.
- It's got a good structure.
- Writing isn't a one-shot deal. You need patience, revisions, and good editing to get it right.
Example: Consider a Lego tower. If you just stack pieces without thinking, it might topple. But with planning and reworking, you can build a sturdy, impressive structure.

## 3. Basic Principles to Keep in Mind

- Be clear and precise.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon. Like, instead of saying "utilize", just say "use".
- Introduce your topic well. Think of it like a movie trailer â€“ give a sneak peek of what's coming.
Example: Remember that episode in Friends where Joey uses a thesaurus for every word in a letter? Don't be Joey!

## 4. Avoid These Writing Pitfalls

- Being too wordy.
- Stuffing too many ideas into one paragraph.
- Using long, fancy words when a simple one will do.
Example: Avoid dressing up your sentences in a tuxedo when casual clothing will do the trick.

## 5. Clarity is King!

- Make your facts straightforward.
- Precision comes from what you choose to include, not squeezing everything into a small space.
- Think of it as decluttering. Keep what's essential and toss out the rest.

## 6. Avoid Hedging

- Hedging means sounding unsure.
Example: Instead of saying "I might probably, sort of think this is a good idea", confidently say "I think this is a good idea."

## 7. Active vs. Passive Voice

- Active voice is direct. Example: "The cat chased the mouse."
- Passive voice is indirect. Example: "The mouse was chased by the cat."
- Active voice is like having a face-to-face conversation, while passive is like listening to someone's voicemail. Which one would you prefer?

## 8. Tenses Matter!

- Using different tenses (present, past, present perfect) tells your reader about the timing and relevance of your research.
Example: Saying "The experiment showed results" is like saying the show is over. But "The experiment has shown results" implies the show is still going on, and there might be more episodes coming.

## 9. Punctuation Matters Too!

- Punctuation in writing is like traffic signals on the road. It guides readers on how to move through your content.
Example: "Let's eat, grandma!" vs. "Let's eat grandma!" Commas save lives!

## 10. Ask Yourself These Questions:

- Is my sentence clear and easy to understand?
- Is it concise or too long-winded?
- Does it flow smoothly to the next point?
Example: Think of your sentences as tracks on an album. Each track should be distinct, but they should flow together to make a great album.

**In summary, technical writing is all about clarity, precision, and structure. Think of your paper or report as a guidebook. If someone's using your guidebook to explore a city (or topic), make sure they don't get lost. Good luck on your exam! You got this!**
